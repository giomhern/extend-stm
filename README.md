# Structural Topic Models for Open-Ended Survey Responses

A replication of research by Roberts et al, *Structural Topic Models for Open-Ended Survey Responses
*. The corresponding files for reference are accessible at [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/29405). My own extension of the project is a WIP and will be documented.
